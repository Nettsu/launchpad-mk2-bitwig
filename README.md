Novation Launchpad MK2 Bitwig Script
=====================================

I wanted to create a Launchpad script that will focus on just launching clips
and nothing else. This has the benefit of a faster, more reliable script, good
for live performance.

One thing to note: groups are NOT expanded, which means each group track is
represented with just one button column. This allows you to fit much more
content on the grid.

Also the right side buttons are configurable - you can switch them between
scene launching buttons and regular clip launching for the 9th track/group. You
will find the switch in the controller settings in Bitwig.
