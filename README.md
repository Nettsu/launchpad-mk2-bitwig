Novation Launchpad MK2 Bitwig Script
=====================================

I wanted to create a Launchpad script that would focus on just launching clips
and nothing else. This has the benefit of a faster, more reliable script, good
for live performance.

One thing to note: groups are NOT expanded, which means each group track is
represented with just one button column. This allows you to fit much more
content on the grid.

The right side buttons are configurable - you can switch them between
scene launching and regular clip launching, which turns them into a 9th column
of pads. You will find the switch in the controller settings in Bitwig.
