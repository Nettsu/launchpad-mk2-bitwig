Novation Launchpad MK2 Bitwig Script
=====================================

I wanted to create a Launchpad script that would focus on just launching clips
and nothing else. This has the benefit of a faster, more reliable script, good
for live performance.

One thing to note: groups are NOT expanded, which means each group track is
represented with just one button column. This allows you to fit much more
content on the grid.

The right side buttons are configurable:
- The 'User 1' button turns them into a map of scenes, with the first button scrolling
  to scenes 1-8, second to scenes 9-16 and so on. The buttons will also show which scenes
  you are currently at.
- The 'User 2' button turns them into a 9th column of clip launching buttons
- The 'Mixer' button makes them launch scenes
